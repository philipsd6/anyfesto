-Once it has rebooted you shoud now have a base Anyfesto Install. Congrats.  When you reboot it you should be able to see it from 
another Wifi connected device broadcasting a SSID with Anyfesto in it. Go ahead and connect from another device, open up a web browser and 
attempt to go to a real or madeup website. You will be redirected to the main webpage which will tell you about some
of the things you can do. 


-Add any additonal audio you want played and shared into /home/anyfesto/content/Radio  Reboot and the new audio will be added to the
playlist

  After several failed starts with Debian I decided to try a Ubuntu Install
  Full desktop, after all we are going to want to be using our snazzy Chromebooks
  while we serve up the local content goodness. And so, Ubuntu Live booted on my 
  Chromebook and did an install onto a second usb stick...
  I was then able to rework the scripts to mostly bring the system up as both a desktop and a
  and all dancing all serving Anyfesto box. Hostap worked, irc, mumble, lighthhtpd all worked. 
  VLC took a little futzing with but I think that is mostly good now. 
  I should have a full step by step for this soon(ish)

   Some things of note:
   -I am using Debian 9 to install the OS onto a USB flash drive. You can use an SD or even a USB HD. 
   - When installing Debian 9 create a user named  "anyfesto" The scripts are set up for that username
   - As you are installing Debain 9 you can choose whatever GUI you want for your desktop. I like XFCE as
      it is slim yet expressive. Your milage will vary, the choice of GUIS will be offered to during install
   - And yes this means while your Chromebook is booked into this you will have a full Desktop Linux to
     do as you want. I'm finding this very useful. 
   - Debian 9 has an issue with SUDO, I will document what needs doing to get it fixed or script a fix if I can

  I ran the base install script minus some PI centric bits on a fresh debian environ living on a USB stick. Hostap is needing some 
  loving with the hammer of justice and the directory structure needs fixing up. But, yeah, this might be doable. More as it happens.

Yep, this is starting to build up from an idea to functional to usable. Stay tuned.
Some points
  I want to set this up as something you can build on a USB flash drive or SD card and boot into when you 
  want to use your Chromebook as a shared resource. Some Chromebooks' bios allow you to boot to usb device, some 
  do not...mine did not. This link fixed that   http://johnlewis.ie/
