	    Open - no auth needed
            Trusted - use of keys and/or CoT 
          Add mutual links to Piratebox shares, fm freqs and the 
          ability to pass msgs. 

[X] - Hardware. Making a case and battery solution that is 
          inexpensive yet reliable. Include such things as a 
          GPIO based kill switch (shutdown, reboot clean, scrub).

[ ]  - Harden and Make Anon
           Secure all the parts and cut out all logs/user/use data.

[ ]  - Secure backhaul to the intertubes (gsm, cell, wifi, etc)
          It should be as secure and anonymous (they are both realtive
          scales and not absolutes) as needed.
